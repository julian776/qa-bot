Docker and Containerization Guide

Docker is a platform that enables developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. These containers can run consistently across different environments, from development to production.

What is Containerization?

Containerization is a virtualization method that packages an application and its dependencies into a single container image. Unlike traditional virtual machines, containers share the host operating system kernel, making them more efficient and faster to start.

Key Benefits of Docker:

1. Consistency: Applications run the same way across different environments
2. Portability: Containers can run on any system that supports Docker
3. Efficiency: Containers use fewer resources than virtual machines
4. Scalability: Easy to scale applications horizontally
5. Isolation: Applications are isolated from each other and the host system

Docker Components:

- Docker Engine: The runtime that manages containers
- Docker Images: Read-only templates used to create containers
- Docker Containers: Running instances of Docker images
- Dockerfile: Text file with instructions to build Docker images
- Docker Compose: Tool for defining and running multi-container applications

Basic Docker Commands:

```bash
# Build an image from a Dockerfile
docker build -t my-app .

# Run a container
docker run -p 8080:80 my-app

# List running containers
docker ps

# List all containers
docker ps -a

# Stop a container
docker stop container_id

# Remove a container
docker rm container_id

# List images
docker images

# Remove an image
docker rmi image_id
```

Creating a Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as base image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements first for better caching
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8000

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

Docker Compose Example:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@db:5432/mydb
    depends_on:
      - db
  
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=mydb
      - POSTGRES_USER=user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pass
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

Best Practices:

1. Use specific base image tags instead of 'latest'
2. Minimize the number of layers in your Dockerfile
3. Use multi-stage builds for smaller images
4. Don't run containers as root user
5. Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files
6. Keep containers stateless and immutable
7. Use health checks for container monitoring
8. Optimize image size by removing unnecessary packages

Docker Networking:

- Bridge Network: Default network for containers on the same host
- Host Network: Container uses the host's network directly
- Overlay Network: Enables communication between containers on different hosts
- Custom Networks: Define your own networks for specific use cases

Docker Volumes:

- Bind Mounts: Mount host directories into containers
- Named Volumes: Docker-managed storage volumes
- tmpfs Mounts: Temporary file systems in memory

Security Considerations:

- Use minimal base images
- Regularly update base images and dependencies
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Implement proper access controls
- Use secrets management for sensitive data
- Enable Docker Content Trust for image verification

Monitoring and Logging:

- Use Docker logs to view container output
- Implement centralized logging with ELK stack or similar
- Monitor container resource usage
- Set up alerts for container failures
- Use Docker stats for real-time monitoring

Docker in Production:

- Use orchestration tools like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm
- Implement proper CI/CD pipelines
- Use container registries for image storage
- Implement proper backup and disaster recovery
- Monitor and log all container activities
- Use service mesh for microservices communication

Troubleshooting Common Issues:

- Container won't start: Check logs and resource constraints
- Network connectivity: Verify network configuration and firewall rules
- Volume mounting issues: Check permissions and mount paths
- Performance problems: Monitor resource usage and optimize images
- Security vulnerabilities: Regular security scans and updates
